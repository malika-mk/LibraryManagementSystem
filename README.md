## Description

The Book Library Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management of books in a library. This system allows users to easily manage books by adding, editing, deleting, and searching them by various criteria (e.g., title, author, genre). It also includes category filters for organizing books. The application uses a database to store information about books, users, and genres. Implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, the system ensures clear separation between the application logic, user interface, and data handling.


## Project Requirements List

Here are the key functionalities required for the successful completion of the Library Management System:

1. User Authentication: Secure login for both administrators and users.
2. Book Management: Add, update, and delete books using the BookDAO methods.
3. Category Navigation: Browse books by category.
4. Search Functionality: Users can search books by name, author, or title.
5. Book Details and Loading: Display detailed book information (description, images, price).
6. Top-Selling and Popular Books: Display the most popular and most liked books.
7. Sales Management: Track book sales and calculate total sales.
8. Image Management: Manage and display book images.
9. Category Management: View and filter books by categories.
10. Data Storage and Connectivity: Efficiently handle data storage and retrieval via the DatabaseConnection.
